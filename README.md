# Palindrome

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar. This definition is from: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome).

As I became annoyed to be asked to solve this algorithm over and over different interviews I decided to put this here. OK, if you ask me I will solve it, but here you go if you don't trust me anyway.

Maybe in a following iteration I will add "sentence palindromes".
